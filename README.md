## Purpose

Service to publish scheduled message to NATS.

Note: This service is not meant to be used in production, as it cannot horizontally scale. Instead the primary purpose is to use it in a non-production/development environment.

## Installation

## Usage

## Start required services for development

```
$ make up-deps
```

## Tear down required services for development

```
$ make down-deps
```

## Configuration

Environment variables used by the service:

| Name                  | Description                                                             | Type          | Default Value |
| ---                   | ---                                                                     | ---           | ---           |
| `LOAD_JOBS_FROM_FILE` | Indicates whether some default jobs should be loaded from files or not. | boolean       | false         |
| `JOB_FILES`           | Comma separated list of extra files to load from.                       | string        | ''            |

## Loading job seeds

- If `LOAD_JOBS_FROM_FILE` all `yml` files in `/opt/scheduler/src/config/job-seeds` will be loaded.
- (Not implemented yet) On top of that one can define additional files to be loaded by passing those in the env variable `JOB_FILES`.

## A job definition file

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: heartbeat       # The name of a job
    enabled: true         # Whether this job is enabled or not
    strategy: cron        # Default strategy for this job, by default only `cron` for now.
    cron:                 # All the cron related settings.
      def: "* * * * * *"  # Definition of the cron job.
    nats:
      subject: foo        # Nats' subject.
    data:                 # Various payload settings, passed over to nats.
      setting1: foo           
      setting2: bar
      setting3: baz
    
```
